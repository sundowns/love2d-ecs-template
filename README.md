# Love2D ECS project quick-start template

A template for Love2D ECS projects with a few core libraries:

- [Concord](https://github.com/Tjakka5/Concord) (ECS)
- [lua-utils](https://github.com/sundowns/lua-utils) (Helper functions)
- [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump) (Helper modules)
  - Timer
  - Vector

The template includes a few component and systems I use universally, namely 2D motion and simple input handling systems.
